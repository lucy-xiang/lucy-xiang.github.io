<h2>Special Projects</h2>
<h3>"Year of the Ox: Self-portrait" FRACTURE Eco-Arts Festival 2022</h3>
<h4>York University</h4>
<p><i>Year of the Ox: Self-portrait</i> is a clay sculpture created for a class in Cultural and Artistic Practices for Environmental and Social Justice at York University.
It was chosen as one of the finalists to be displayed at York University during their Eco-Arts Festival in 2022. It explores the relationship between personal, cultural, and 
animal identities. Through molding of white clay into an oxen embedded in green moss, the sculpture communicates the celebration of Chinese cultural symbolism and how it can
ground personal identity. This piece incorporates numerous symbols from the artist's childhood like red thread, gold beads and zodiac animals to explore how heritage promotes
healing but is also a site of rejection, disconnection, and confusion.</p>
